# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction System

A Machine Learning web application that predicts agricultural crop yield based on environmental and farming inputs.

Built using **Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a Machine Learning model to predict crop yield based on:

- Crop Year
- Area (in hectares)
- Annual Rainfall (mm)
- Fertilizer usage (kg)
- Pesticide usage (kg)

The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
